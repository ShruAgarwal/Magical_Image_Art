 ### 🛠 App is built with libraries 
 1️⃣ `opencv` -- for applying effects on the image
 
 2️⃣ `numpy`  -- is used to convert, read, perform array methods on the image 
 
 3️⃣ `Pillow` -- used to convert the numpy array & return back an image  
 
 4️⃣ `streamlit` -- for hosting the UI for the App
 
 5️⃣ `streamlit_image_comparison` -- for showcasing the effects applied!
 
 ### 💡 Idea behind building this App 
 Well, I've already tried the `Pencil Sketch Effect` using OpenCV, but never thought of applying such amazing effects on an Image using Python! 
 Learnt a lot while trying these effects as well as unleashed the power of OpenCV in general. 😉
