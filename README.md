## Magical Image Art ‚ú®ü§Ø

### Try it here : [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://shruagarwal-magical-image-art-st-app-k0n0bb.streamlitapp.com/)


**This App can** :
 - Convert & Apply three different styling effects to an Image üåà
 - Style Effects are --> *Pop / dotted art, Cartoon art, Water Color Painted art*
 
 ### App is built with libraries 
 1Ô∏è‚É£ `opencv` -- for applying effects on the image
 
 2Ô∏è‚É£ `numpy`  -- is used to convert, read, perform array methods on the image 
 
 3Ô∏è‚É£ `Pillow` -- used to convert the numpy array & return back an image  
 
 4Ô∏è‚É£ `streamlit` -- for hosting the UI for the App
 
 5Ô∏è‚É£ `streamlit_image_comparison` -- for showcasing the effects applied!
 
 ### üí° Idea behind building this App 
 Well, I've already tried the `Pencil Sketch Effect` using OpenCV, but never thought of applying such amazing effects on an Image using Python! 
 Learnt a lot while trying these effects as well as unleashed the power of OpenCV in general. üòâ
